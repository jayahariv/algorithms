# algorithms

This section is for learning some basic algorithms and practices. It contains two folders one for ObjectiveC algorithms and other for Swift algorithms.

## Swift
Swift algorithms needs to be implemented in a functional way, where as the ObjC was completely straight forward. I tried best to keep it readable and functional. Inside swift folder you can see only the swift files, and not playground. 

### How to compile and run
- Open the terminal
- Check for swift installed in the terminal by typing _swift_, 
  - if not installed, check this link and follow the steps [Getting Started Swift](https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift)
  - if you see the version, yay you are already having the swift. type _:quit_ to exit or explore using _:help_.
- Go inside the Swift folder. For example, _cd ~/Downloads/algorithms/swift_
- Compile any swift file, _swiftc \<filename\>.swift -o output_. For example, _swiftc ArrayRotate.swift -o output_
- Run compiled file, _./output_


#### Why not playground? 
It was super slow for me to compile, edit and save with playground. It made me to quit and restart the xcode multiple times due to infinite loading. That made me to think about cavemen style(for most people, not for me) of compilation, which is super fast when compared to algorithm.
